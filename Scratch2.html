            <h3 class="Myfont2">Finance</h3>
            <P class="Myfont3">For as long as I can remember I have loved saving money. Sometimes my Mom claims I am too
                frugal or go to extremes but I for one disagree. I was shown a loan ammortization chart when I was about
                twelve years old and that really sparked my interest in Finance. I find it facinating how using money
                wisely can save or even earn huge dividends. I really enjoy learning about how to manage it well, and
                the skills I have developed in this IS class have only strengthened my resolve to learn and become
                better</p>

            <p class="Myfont4">Music has played a large role in my life, I began learning how to play the piano at age
                seven and continue to this day. Along with the piano, I played the Viola which in all honesty was not my
                favorite, if you are planning to learn an orchestral instrument I recommend that you go with the cello.
                I recently also began learning the guitar which I love a lot. I like to write my own songs and ad-lib,
                but I am traditionally taught and can read music. To the left I embedded one of my favorite pieces to
                play, Jarrod Radnich is my favorite arranger.

            <h3 class="Myfont2 list2">Language</h3>
            <p class="Myfont3">I really enjoy learning languages. As I mentioned on the home page, I served about half
                my mission in Mexico, and this is where I really found my love and abillity to learn languages. I picked
                up spanish pretty quick, in just about three months I was able to understand and communicate fairly
                well. I wanted to develope even further however. I have set my sights on other latin based languages. My
                goal is that before I die I want to learn Spanish, Portugese, French, and Italian, that way I would be
                able to communicate with almost everybody in Europe and south america.</p>

            <h3 class="Myfont">Politics</h3>
            <p class="Myfont4">Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation,
                conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are
                engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
                can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of
                that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It
                is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate --
                we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
                here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.</p>
